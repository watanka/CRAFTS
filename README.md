## CRAFT-Reimplementation

This is reimplementation of [Character Region Attention For Text Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09629).
I used [backtime92's CRAFT-Reimplementation](https://github.com/backtime92/CRAFT-Reimplementation) code and [What Is Wrong With Scene Text Recognition Model Comparisons? Dataset and Model Analysis](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark) to implement CRAFTS.
